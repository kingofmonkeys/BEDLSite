#TOPIC#New Season Info#BREAK#9/17/2018#BREAK#
New season information is up on the website.  The handicap system has changed a good bit, we have spread the handicap levels so more people are rank 4 and 5 and we reduced the amount of handicap between ranks.  These changes mean many players rankings have changed and the handicap between rankings have changed please look on the roster page for your new rank.  Please check out the handicap rules on the site (Documents > <a href="./handicaps.php">Handicap Rules</a>).

I have ended the end of season round robin schedule to the site.  The standard schedule page shows the home teams but it DOESN'T show which bar you are shooting at since the home team bar might not have room that night so please look at the round robin schedule at the bottom of the page.
