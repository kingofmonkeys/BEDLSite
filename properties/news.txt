#TOPIC#End of Season Meeting#BREAK#2/8/2018#BREAK#
The board would like to have a meeting after our dart party and before the next season so that everyone has a chance to tell us what they thought worked and things they would like to maybe see changed. Bring us your ideas to make improvements, only as a group working together can we continue to grow this league.
<br/><br/>
The meeting will be held at Brewers on either Thursday 3/1 or 3/8, we will go with majority rules in picking the date. We will hold a luck after the meeting with the bar adding to the pot. If we have at least 16 members in attendance, the league will also add $50 to the payout.
<br/><br/>
Please comment below with date preference, I will also have a sheet at the party where you can let us know if you have a particular preference for the date. Looking forward to seeing everyone at the party !!!

Stats are done for the season, let me know if you see something wrong.  Remember shooters on division 2 teams got an average for the week they didn't shoot in the end of season round robin.</br></br>

#TOPIC#New Season!#BREAK#9/12/2017#BREAK#
New season starts this Thursday 9/14/2017! <br/><br/>
With the new season we have a new website, new by-laws and some new rules.  If you find a problem with the website please let Jimmy know ASAP, this is still a bit of a work in progress so some things will not work correctly.  Also the new handicap rules and player ranks are now available under the documents section.  Please review since there have been alot of changes to the handicap rules for this season.
