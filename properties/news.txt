#TOPIC#New Season Info#BREAK#9/17/2018#BREAK#
New season information is up on the website.  The handicap system has changed a good bit, we have spread the handicap levels so more people are rank 4 and 5 and we reduced the amount of handicap between ranks.  These changes mean many players rankings have changed and the handicap between rankings have changed please look on the roster page for your new rank.  Please check out the handicap rules on the site (Documents > <a href="./handicaps.php">Handicap Rules</a>).

I have ended the end of season round robin schedule to the site.  The standard schedule page shows the home teams but it DOESN'T show which bar you are shooting at since the home team bar might not have room that night so please look at the round robin schedule at the bottom of the page.

The board would like to have a meeting after our dart party and before the next season so that everyone has a chance to tell us what they thought worked and things they would like to maybe see changed. Bring us your ideas to make improvements, only as a group working together can we continue to grow this league.

The meeting will be held at Brewers on either Thursday 3/1 or 3/8, we will go with majority rules in picking the date. We will hold a luck after the meeting with the bar adding to the pot. If we have at least 16 members in attendance, the league will also add $50 to the payout.

#TOPIC#New Season!#BREAK#9/12/2017#BREAK#
New season starts this Thursday 9/14/2017! <br/><br/>
With the new season we have a new website, new by-laws and some new rules.  If you find a problem with the website please let Jimmy know ASAP, this is still a bit of a work in progress so some things will not work correctly.  Also the new handicap rules and player ranks are now available under the documents section.  Please review since there have been alot of changes to the handicap rules for this season.
